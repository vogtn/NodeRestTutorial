Tutorial of REST by Christopher Buecheler

The purpose of this tutorial was to introduce myself to one of the several advantages of Node.js enviornment. Specifically, <b>REST.</b> The author, Christopher Buecheler
gives a wonderfully simple definition of REST(<i>Representational State Transfer</i>) and the advantage of its implementations in a realistic setting. The
idea is to use explict HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE), use stateless design, create purposefully named Urls, and use XML/JSON as backend. 

This is fleshed out in a simple web app which utilizes:
  <li>node.js </li>
  <li>express </li>
  <li>mongoDB </li>
  <li>jade </li>
  
  To create a simple web app which stores, creates, and deletes users from a user database.
